# [Kick](http://vctrfrnndz.com/projects/zeropress)

Kick is collection of useful [LESS mixins](http://lesscss.org/) for use on any project.

Many of the mixins, styles and other parts of this library were borrowed from other open-source projects, including [Preboot](https://github.com/mdo/Preboot), [HTML5 Boilerplate](https://github.com/h5bp/html5-boilerplate), and [Clearless](https://github.com/clearleft/clearless).
